#### Hello, World!
It's been a while, where should I begin?

I don't think I am used anymore at the idea of "putting myself out there" - let alone of writing down my thoughts, experiences and ideas on a blog for everyone to read. I feel a little rusty, words struggle a bit to come out - and I find it funny, considering that those who know me, in person, could say instead that I tend to never shut up.

The truth is that lately I started feeling the need, once again, for a place where I could expand myself, experiment, awaken - and even create new junctions in areas of my life that don't necessarily overlap. A place where I could explore my vocations and passions and bring them close together. A place to nurture creativity, inspiration and curiosity. A unique, big, spacious plaza where all the tiny characters that populate my creative world can hang out with each other.

So I rolled up my sleeves and did the thing that more than anything comes natural to me: I built one myself. And here we are, standing in the middle of it, right now. Welcome!

#### Have a seat
See, I like the idea of using a plaza as an analogy for this place, because that's somewhat how I ended up spontaneously envisioning it. Not a street - that leads to one direction only. Nor a station: it would feel more like a waiting area; but a cozy square where you can run into all sorts of stores and meet all kinds of people strolling around.

I have big ambitions for this place, yet at the same time I have none. I intend to write extensively about the things I am learning and the projects I am working on - including, for instance, the whole process behind this website - but I also aim to keep it as spontaneous and authentic as possible. I have a lead sheet in front of me, and I can't wait to begin improvising all around it.

So feel free to have a seat, if you like it. There's a bench just right there. Catch you later!
