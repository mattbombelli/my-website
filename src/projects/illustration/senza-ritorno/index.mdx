	Walter, a little kid chased by bullies, seeks help from the odd videogame merchant that everyone in town appears to stay away from.
	\
	\
	Through a bizarre device labeled "Senza Ritorno" (_No return_) he finds himself tossed in a whimsical and metaphysical town where there seems to be no way out. His only hope is to rely on the eccentric creatures he encounters along the way.
