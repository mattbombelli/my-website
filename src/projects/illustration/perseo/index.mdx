<Slide class="col-one-three text-slide">
	When Perseus gets challenged by Polydectes to kill the Gorgon Medusa — capable of turning aynone into stone by the mere power of her glance — Hermes and Athena commend him to seek the help of the three Graeae, sisters of the Gorgons.
	\
	\
	But the three Graeae, who share only one eye and one tooth among them, won't easily offer their aid.
	\
	\
	Perseus steals then their eye and extort the information he needs from them.
